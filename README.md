Extendable, completely modular, CMS

# About

## What is it?
  Cube is a modular content-management-system. Everything in cube is divided into small bits called cubes. 
  
  The [cube-core](/ContentCube/cube-core) will include basic functionality, like an admin panel, but that is it. 
  
## Aim
  To Be completely extendable, and open source.
  
  Unix like philosophy, do one thing, and do it well.
  
  Easy to use.
  
## Why?
  We like building challenging things.

## Technologies
  At the moment, cube is still very early on. The few technologies we know will be used are below:
  - Node.js
  - Express.js
  - MongoDB
  - Mongoose ORM

  The unique architecture of Cube means that these technologies could change, and other cubes could also use different technologies.
